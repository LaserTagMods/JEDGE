1. Identify the modded BRX that most commonly has issues and update to this firmware: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaserTagMods/JEDGE/main/JEDGE3.0/JEDGE_TAGGERS_BETA.ino

2. Plug in USB cable between PC and modded BRX built in standard data usb port.

3. Prepare all other taggers and JEDGE and activate JEDGE as normal

4. Turn on modded BRX that is plugged into your computer

5. Open arduino ide program on the computer

6. Under the dorpdowns, go to Tools, Port, and select the port that is available for the BRX
   (if not sure which port, turn brx off and see which port does not appear after trying to find port again.

7. Once connected to brx port, open serial monitor via tools, serial monitor, or just press ctr+Shft+m

8. in the serial monitor, at the top, there is a text entry bar, type in "DEBUG" and press enter

9. some options will display in the serial monitor. If not, then your not connected.

10. If Deep Debug IR, or something like that appears (#4 i think) type in the corresponding numbe rand press enter.

11. Now all the things going on with the BRX are displayed here, if you did it correctly.

12. run games as normal and watch the serial monitor and start a game.

13. If the tagger starts normally, then the issue wasnt captured. If it did get messed up, issue is captured

14. If tagger did not start normally, copy all the information from the serial monitor and paste into a text file and send to me.

15. If tagger started normally, press the clear output button on the serial monitor (bottom right), then try again until it gets messed up.
