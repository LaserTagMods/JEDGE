JEDGE 3.0 Read Me:
----------------------------------
Ok, it's finally here, my final version that I'll be doing for JEDGE, I promise No more major changes oving forward. It has been a long learning process and I've gotten better and better and learned more and ore and I don't know any other way to simplify JEDGE any more than this version.


The Skimmy:
----------------------------------
JEDGE 3.0 is a connectionless application less version of JEDGE. Previous versions requiring a designated raspberry Pi server and WiFi network to support devices has been very clunky and a lot of work to set up as well as difficult for updates because of the complexities of using BLYNK. This version uses ESPNOW that is an espress if communications protocol (same manufacturer of the ESP chips. The way that I am using ESPNow is by modifying MAC addresses of the ESP's with software and broadcasting data between devices similar to short range radio broadcasts but on the 2.4 ghz Spectrum so that all devices listening in on the same frequency can pick them up and the data sent is targeted to the modified/shared MAC address.  Just like WIFI this is dependent upon your proximity to the device broadcasting the data so take that into consideration. Also, ditching the Blynk app I'm now using a web server in each device so that Any tagger can serve as a host for games, or you can have a separate device (ESP) that is just dedicated as a controller for the games. Using a web server allows me to use html/Java in a way to create a website that can be accessed from any Web browser enabled device, and run the games and change game settings as well as get game scoring results. I.E a tv can be used to display scores while your mobile phone (android/iOS) can run the games. 

There is no limit to how many modified taggers that can be controlled, since this is a general broadcasted hosting system. This will also allow for tagger to tagger communication in game that  can be used anywhere and is not confined to the limits of a local WiFi/area network. It does not require any internet connection and all work is handled by the ESP32 that needs to be wired to the BRX and installed inside or externally as  desired for your own purposes. I.E. if you are a mile away from the start point in an all out battle field simulation, as long as you are in  range of another players broadcast (this should usually be the case except for really far sniper shots) the player making a kill will receive a kill confirmations from the tagged player and be able to keep their own kill count on their tagger during play. Downed players will also keep a log of who killed them so that at the end of the game there can be a true up synchronization for accurate scoring.

Because of unreliability of consumer available hardware, IR emittin bases for game play can be a bit  limiting on potential game play options. ESP powered bases (JBOX) will be able to send data, commands, field upgrades/perks wirelessly to player activating bases or loot boxes during the game. This results in a much more accurate and capable in game accessory capability than IR emitting bases ever would be able to provide. An example is a respawn station that when activated sends a respawn dedicated to that player alone and other players in the proximity would not be able to benefit from a general respawn station. Or domination zones that when captured, the player controlling a zone is free to roam in the controlled area and points can accumulate while protecting that zone. This can also allow for wide spread damage to players within a zone that is being bombed or controlled to reduce a playing field over time.

Parts Needed to Mod:
----------------------------------



How to Use it:
----------------------------------
1.	Turn on the hosting device (if being used)
2.	Turn on all modified taggers
3.	Log into the hosting device or hosting tagger by connecting to its WiFi network with a computer or mobile device
a.	Example: SSID: GUN#1, Pass: 123456789
4.	Navigate to the url: 192.168.4.1
5.	Press the “Initialize JEDGE” button
a.	This locks out players abilities to press buttons and mess with things
6.	Allow players to access taggers or issue them out
7.	Scroll through and make changes to the game options as desired
8.	Press “Start Game” when ready
9.	Press “End Game” to terminate a game, understand that players need to be in range of your hosting device in order for this to work
10.	After a game is over, Press “Sync Scores” once players are gathered together again.
11.	Scroll down to the Team totals report, game highlights and individual player scores to review and share the scoring information. (syncing scores will take about ten seconds or so)

Game Settings Notes:
----------------------------------
Weapon Selections – 
1.	The pistol is only available for selection under primary weapon.
2.	Manual selection requires players to pull the trigger on their taggers to cycle through the weapon options/choices. Once they have found the one they want, they must press the alt-fire button to confirm their selection. If they do not press alt-fire, their selection will automatically be locked in upon game start
3.	Unarmed is just that, there will be no weapon selected for that option. 

Lives – 
1.	Unlimited is actually not limited but close enough… it sets lives for 32,000 lives. Once a player runs out of lives in a game they will be out and not able to continue play. The tagger will announce “lives depleted”

Game Time – 
1.	Setting game time to unlimited is not really unlimited but 20 billion milliseconds which the batteries would die before the roughly 5 thousand hours are up.
2.	Each tagger keeps track of the game time on their own
3.	When the time is up, taggers will exit game play mode and announce “game over”
4.	There are also some audio indicators in there when getting close to the end of the game to announce to players the end is coming.

Team Modes – 
1.	Free for all sets all players to the red team but activates friendly fire so everyone can shoot eachother, team scoring will be weird since everyone is on the same team… technically
2.	Two Teams (odds and evens) sets all odd players against all even players automatically
3.	Three teams (every third player) sets players 1, 4, 7, 10, … to one team; 0, 3, 6, 9, … to another team; 2, 5, 8, 11, …. to another team. 
4.	Four teams (every fourth player) sets players 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, …. to one team; 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, … to another team; 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, … to another team; 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, … to the last team.
5.	Manual selections allows players to set their own teams by pulling the trigger and then locking in their team selection by pressing the alt-fire button.
6.	In Infection Mode, manual team selection is required and is limited to only red and green or human and infected.

Respawn Modes:
1.	Automatic respawns causes players to automatically respawn into play as long as they have time left in the game and have not depleted all their lives.  Players have to wait the designated time frame until they can respawn back into play
2.	Manual respawn requires players to respawn from a base or another player, depending on game play. 

Delayed Start:
1.	Delayed start allows for players to have time to spread out before the game starts up. There is a count down to let players know right before the game starts. Change this setting to suit your play area and what makes sense to allow players to get to some cover or the start points.

Ammunition Modes:
1.	Unlimited Mags means that players can reload their weapon as often as they need or see fit. They will not run out of bullets… well.. its set for around 999,999 rounds anyway.
2.	Unlimited Rounds means that players have a bottomless clip/magazine. The players will never need to reload. This is a great mode for kids that have a hard time pulling the reload handle or if you remove them because of difficulty in storing/transporting the taggers with the handle.
3.	Limited means that each weapon selection has a balanced number of rounds depending on the weapon type. They ammunition quantity is what battle company preset for the weapon counts from the CallSign application they released to work with the equipment. This is for experienced players and more realistic type game play battles. See the weapons list/specs: https://github.com/LaserTagMods/JEDGE/blob/main/JEDGE3.0/Weapons%20Specs.pdf

Melee Mode:
1.	You can toggle melee to off/on/disarm. Under disarm/arm Melee will cause players to lose their weapons instead of take damage. This can be used for taking prisoners and gun point if your able to pull it off and take hostages. Be careful though, because you can arm them if you melee them a second time as it both arms and disarms players. This allows for team mates to rescue them and arm them for their escape.

Preset Game Modes:
I have put together quick start game settings to make game starting faster/easier. Be careful though because some of the game modes modify game play so be sure to go do default if playing a complicated game set up so that it makes sure it changes the way the taggers behave, if changing your game mode the next match. Note that after selecting a preset game mode you can modify/customize it as well.

* This game starts you out with an unlimited ammo pistol that you will have no matter what. You can loot bases though and pick up weapon upgrades for your secondary weapon to switch to. If you don’t want the weapon you pick up, don’t press the select button to automatically discard it and keep what you have. Each time you loot, you have a chance to get armor, health, shields or additional ammo for your secondary weapon you already have equipped. 1/10 chance for full health and shields and armor, 2/10 chance for health restoration, 2/10 chance for armor replenish, 1/3 chance for ammo pick up, weapon pick up is randomized between the 18 different guns. This mode also gives you the ability to revive others…. Press the right button on the d-pad to send out a revive IR from your tagger to respawn teams/alliances made in the game. But consider… who really can be trusted? If your dead… you may be able to get others to bring you back in… but for how long before they shoot you in the back after using you? That is the question…

Disclaimers:
----------------------------------
JEDGE is an open source project that was mostly coded by one individual, but with contributions from many, to pull it all together. Thousands of thanks are owed to all of those who have contributed to this work in the devlopment of JEDGE. It would not have been possible without your support!
The devices do need to be hard wired in with quick disconnect means. If you wish to integrate this system, you will need to be handy, or know someone who is, with a soldering Iron. Don't be intimidated though, it is easy to learn and get good at it with a bit of practice. The microcontrollers can be powered by the BRX Tagger and fit inside the battery compartment of the tagger. Soldering the connections correctly will not compromise the functionality of the tagger. In fact, the offline game modes still will work exactly as before the JEDGE upgrade and even callsign and battle royale (manufacturer supported mobile apps) will still work normally. The worse that can happen is that you damage the bluetooth connectivity with a poor quality solder and then you render the mobile applications non functional... leaving offline game modes still functional. This is a risk to be aware of... but as they say, no risk, no reward. We are constantly working on improvements to the game functions for JEDGE... Unlike the manufacturer for their mobile apps, and there is much more versatility in JEDGE. 
*** NOTE: This is an opensource design, not supported by the manufacturer but an aftermarket modification to the equipment, proceed at your own risk. As is with all open source projects, this is free to all. Not to be profitted from without authorization from the original designer/coder of the project. This is put together by a great group of individuals who shared a common interest and got together to share ideas and make it happen, please do not take advantage of their time and efforts. If you wish to contribute, please do so. The group is found on facebook: BRX Elite Owners Group and the forum: lasertaginfo.org. Also, No promises of support, guarantees of functionality/performance are provided with this collaborative project.

General Use Guidelines:
----------------------------------
The system is designed so that all players start in the same location, within range of a hosting device which can be a tagger with the software  installed or a standalone esp32.
1. One individual uses the mobile app to modify the game settings as desired
2. Taggers announce confirmations of the game settings being selected
2. The individual using the mobile app presses "start game"
3. Players' taggers announce that it is time to "move out"
4. Players disperse and the game starts as had been programmed by the application
5. After receiving the notification to "move out", players no longer need to stay within range of the hosting device
6. After the players either (1) run out of lives, (2) game objectives are met, (3) time runs out, Players should return to the starting location near the hosting device
7. Upon returning, the individual using the app, can either (1) send new game settings, (2) press start game to repeat the previous game, (3) sync scores, as applies, (4) any combination of the previous options

Things You Should Know:
----------------------------------
Installing esp32 boards to your arduino IDE:
https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/
Some Libraries you will need: 
Async and Json libraries: I followed this tutorial and the sections at the top of the tutorial for Async and Json: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-esp-now-wi-fi-web-server/
OTA update libraries and know how:  I followed this tutorial: https://lastminuteengineers.com/esp32-ota-updates-arduino-ide/
Tip: when installing the JSON resources, you can return in the JSON library references to keep both the 8266, esp32 boards always available from the dropdown board selections

My boards Purchased:
----------------------------------
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32827149250.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.6f5d4c4drgvrDP

Prepping the BRX :
----------------------------------
The BRX has some anoying audio files and limited gun name conventions in the audio driver. 
Within the repository are new audio files that should be added to each BRX Audio folder. The files
Are GN01 through GN19. These are used by the Configurator to identify what gun players are selecting when manual
Weapon selection is enabled. This is highly recommended. Also it's Paul's voice which makes it kinda cool

Also, delete or rename the following audio file names to make them stop being annoying or interupting start up time

I just renamed them so i can recall them later if I want:
VA9U changed to XYZ1
JA9 changed to XYZ2

Others just have changed the extension from LTP to OLD, whatever works.

Keep in mind that if you remove the music, it does limit your ability to put the tagger into target mode, target mode requires a button held for an extended time before getting into game options.

Prepping the Arduino INO before Upload:
Hardware: ESP32 D1 Mini
Solder, connect, wire, etc. pins 16 to the tagger Bluetooth rx pin or brx tx pin 17 to Bluetooth tx pin or brx rx pin, Vcc to Vcc.
Board Manager Specifics:
ESP32: Use Wemos D1 Mini ESP32 board and change partition scheme to "Minimum Spiffs (large apps with OTA)"
Before thinking about uploading the software, watch the following tips videos for the programs to make sure you set up the code properly by changing the important definitions in the code. You need to change the wifi network for the OTA updating, each tagger needs to have a unique ID 0-63
I recommend testing one tagger out before proceeding the the next one to make sure you got it right and before you repeat the process for multiple taggers


OTA :
----------------------------------
If you are updating to a new configurator firmware version/release and are already running an OTA version:

Before beginning, make sure your running Python on your computer:
  For Python installation to enable OTA update from your Arduino IDE, follow Step #1: https://lastminuteengineers.com/esp8266-ota-updates-arduino-ide/

1. Pressing the OTA button causes both the esp32 to stop listening to ESPNOW    this will ensure that your esp32 is only listening to the OTA Python uploading software
2. Connect your computer to an available LAN port on your router. This ensures that you are able to see the ESP32s.
   This is not an requirement per say as Ive been able to update firmware OTA without being connected to the LAN, but it is buggy and troublesome.
   If not using LAN you may have to close your arduino IDE out completely and re-open it and possibly restart your computer in order to view the esp32 ports
3. Under tools in the Arduino IDE, you will now see the serial numbers listed for all the taggers that are sitting in OTA UPDATE Mode. 
   Also note that they are displayed by the tagger ID number as well. This is so you can identify each tagger and update them one by one
   IF they are not listed, restart your computer, if not fixed, then have you installed python on your PC? Follow these online tutorial above.
4. Now that you have selected the correct port for the tagger that you want to update, just press the upload button.
Here is a good reference as well if you want to learn more: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-ota-updates-with-arduino-ide-over-the-air/
Tip: Also, if your having a hard time getting the esp32s to respond to arduino IDE OTA, it could be the router firewall... Ive had a tough time with some routers 
and a cake walk with others... I recommend opening your firewall settings and allowing arduino and espota.py applications through the firewall, or just disable 
The firewall while you update the taggers.

Configurator install:  
----------------------------------  
Gen 2 install: https://youtu.be/rDPo6_XNH6k

JEDGE troubleshooting:
----------------------------------
There’s ways to trouble shoot:
Debug mode on brx to watch serial output: indicates if your connections are good between pin 17 and the brx rx pin
Use serial monitor on esp (outside brx) and watch for confirmations for commands being sent from app as well as watch and see If weird stuff is going on across the board on multiple esp32s and it’s not isolated to one or two, it’s a code issue and I screwed something up.
