Please Note:

You need the ESP32U plus antenna, you can use other ones but the 32U has advantages over others. I used to try and go as cheap as possible but Iâ€™ve been burned to many times. If you go with a non 32U you may not fit my PCB if wanting to use it. Others likely have a built-in antenna too.
LoRa module is Optional
Keyed Switch and HC-05 are for first generation taggers (legacy)
