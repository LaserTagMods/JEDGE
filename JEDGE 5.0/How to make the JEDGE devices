Tagger JEDGE controllers:

You will need one device per tagger and based upon what generation of tagger and your preferences.
I've provided the minimum requirements as well as options for each tagger generation below.
In the links file, here on the GitHub, I have links to the components.

The JEDGE PCB is just a way to reduce wiring for me. PCBs, once learned how to design/order, are just a good way to control wiring and simplify multi-component builds. Not essential but for me a nice to have.



Gen1 Tagger:
-------------
MUST HAVE
1. ESP32U
2. Power Switch
3. Wire taps to the battery leads and wire

RECOMMENDED
4. HC-05

OPTIONAL
5. JEDGE PCB
6. RYLR896/890

INSTRUCTIONS: 

(ESP Bluetooth classic only - not consistent performance)
1. Wire battery positive lead to power switch then to the 5v input on the ESP32U.
2. Wire battery negative to esp32u ground

(Hardwired option - not consistent performance)
3. Wire pin 16 to tagger Bluetooth slave TX and pin 17 to tagger Bluetooth slave RX.

(HC-05 - much more stable method)
4. Connect 3v pin is esp to hc-05, esp ground to hc-05 grnd, esp pin 17 to hc-05 RX, esp pin 16 to hc-05 tx.

(HC-05 alternate and Lora option including PCB)
5. Solder essential and optional pins of HC-05 to JEDGE PCB
6. Solder essential and optional pins of RYLR896 to JEDGE PCB
7. Solder essential and optional pins of ESP32U to JESGE PCB


Gen2 Tagger:
-------------
MUST HAVE
1. ESP32U
2. Use jst female lead to power esp32 from 5v power port on tagger or power separately as desired

OPTIONAL
3. JEDGE PCB
4. RYLR896/890

INSTRUCTIONS: 

(ESP BLE only decent performance)
1. Wire battery positive lead to 5V output on brx main board or power as desired from battery.
2. Wire battery negative to esp32u ground

(Hardwired option - pretty good performance)
3. Wire pin 16 to tagger Bluetooth slave TX and pin 17 to tagger Bluetooth slave RX.

(Lora option including PCB)
4. Solder essential and optional pins of RYLR896 to JEDGE PCB
5. Solder essential and optional pins of ESP32U to JESGE PCB
