HOW IT WORKS:

The BRX is equipped with a Bluetooth module that allows for the third party app development to manage pretty much every aspect of the functionality of the tagger.

ESP32 devices have two processing cores and built in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capability. Maximizing its potential, though the devices have only one antenna I’m able to run Bluetooth and Wi-Fi together on the same radio channel to pair the esp32s to the taggers. Some taggers (first generation) use Bluetooth classic and require an additional HC-05 Bluetooth module to optimize the communication as I’ve found the esp32’s classic Bluetooth capability functional and successful but not consistent.

Each tagger needs to individually be set up to pair to its permanent tagger. They also need to be assigned a unique ID number for scoring purposes. Taggers should be marked accordingly to visually communicate which tagger is which player.

Once Taggers are properly modified with the ESP32, using Wi-Fi type communication with ESSPRESS-IF’s ESP-NOW communications protocol, the host controller communicate with each tagger.

Additionally, the ESP32 can also use an RYLR896/890 module to communicate between taggers and the host controller, providing long range communication at a slower data transmission rate. This is helpful for when players play outside the range of each other so that play control/communication can still be established for kill confirmations or when a game is over.

By using over the air communication between taggers and a host, the ESP32 can take the data transmitted and control functionality of the tagger from simply announcing an existing audio file in the brx memory or ending/starting a game and changing the taggers settings.
