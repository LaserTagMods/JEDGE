THE GENERAL IDEA

Due to the nature of the BRX the game setting menu is complicated for beginners, and it is time consuming to educate players on the settings/options as well as get players on the correct settings to efficiently run games. The mobile applications for the system have also proven problematic and difficult to use. Therefore, I saw a need for my passion of laser tag to be smoother and get more play time as well as have a good solution for score reporting.

JEDGE (J-EDGE) Is my way of turning the BRX into a commercial grade system, well at least an attempt at it. A single ESP32 acts as a hosting device to master configure other ESP32 devices that are individually installed onto BRX taggers and to control them as the master/host demands. The individual devices lock out the button pushing and potential for player errors while handling the BRX taggers.

The Dream is to fully enable the capabilities of the BRX as there is so much more that lies beneath the surface but wants to get out!
