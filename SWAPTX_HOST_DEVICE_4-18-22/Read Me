The SwapTX Hosting Controller:

This devices is intended to replace the use of a host tagger. In addition to the ability to replace the host tagger, controlling game ending 
conditions as well as the ability to have a live scoreboard is intended. Two web servers are hosted on an ESP32 with the intention of having
a cell phone connected to the game controls and a larger tablet or PC monitor connected to live scoring updates to be displayed

In addition, I have integrated live scoring for JBOX devices that are placed in Domination Node Lora mode, where Lora is used to transmit
domination status for JBOXs that are in play to have multiple bases serving as domination stations and for this controller to also track the
score from the domination boxes as a domination master. This will allow for one device to serve as a primary device for game control/monitoring.

How to Use:

1. Turn on all Swaptx guns and headsets
2. Turn on the host controller device
3. Connect to the device's wifi by entering 123456789 as the password or scanning the wifi qr
4. Open the scoreboard web page by entering the following into a web browser or scanning the associated qr code: 192.168.4.1
5. Open the Game controls web page by entering the following in a web browser or scanning the associated qr code: 192.168.4.1:81
6. Press the host taggers button to lock out taggers.
7. Congigure drop down game settings as desired
8. Start game when ready and End Game when ready
9. Allow players to change teams by pressing the "allow team changes" button in between games
10. Monitor the score by accessing the scoreboard web application for live updates that refresh after each new game start

Creating a Controller:

I recommend the following device hardware:
1. ESP32U with external antenna:

4. Install Arduino IDE on your computer: 
   https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
5. Download all the libraries in my JEDGE Github:
   https://github.com/LaserTagMods/JEDGE/tree/main/Essential%20Libraries
6. Set up your computer to work with an ESP32: 
   https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/
7. Download the Swaptx Controller Files and open in Arduino IDE:
   https://github.com/LaserTagMods/JEDGE/tree/main/SWAPTX_HOST_DEVICE_4-18-22
8. Compile and upload to an ESP32

Note: if you have to small a flash on your esp32 board, change the partition settings to allow for a larger application
